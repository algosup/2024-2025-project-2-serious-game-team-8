## KPI Review

### üïµÔ∏è What has been quality checked?

#### **Alignment with Project Goals**

- [ ] Do the KPIs align with the overall objectives of the project?

#### **Specificity**

- [ ] Are the KPIs specific and clearly defined?  
- [ ] Is it clear what each KPI measures and why it is important?  
- [ ] Are the KPIs easily understood by all team members?  

#### **Measurability**

- [ ] Can the KPIs be measured with available tools and resources?  
- [ ] Are the metrics quantifiable (e.g., app crash rate, user retention rate)?  
- [ ] Is there a clear methodology for collecting and analyzing the data for each KPI?  

#### **Relevance**

- [ ] Do the KPIs address the most critical aspects of the project, such as app performance, card usability, or player satisfaction?  
- [ ] Are the KPIs actionable, providing data that the team can use to improve performance?  
- [ ] Do the KPIs cover both short-term deliverables and long-term project outcomes?  

#### **Attainability**

- [ ] Are the KPIs realistic given the project‚Äôs timeline, resources, and constraints?  
- [ ] Do they reflect the team‚Äôs current capacity and skill set?

- [ ] Is there a review mechanism to update or discard KPIs that become irrelevant?  

#### **Balance**

- [ ] Do the KPIs cover a balanced range of project aspects (e.g., technical performance, user feedback, team productivity)?  
- [ ] Is there a mix of leading indicators (predicting future performance) and lagging indicators (evaluating past performance)?  
- [ ] Are the KPIs balanced between qualitative (e.g., player satisfaction) and quantitative measures (e.g., bug counts)?  

#### **Stakeholder Inclusion**

- [ ] Were stakeholders consulted during the development of the KPIs?  
- [ ] Do the KPIs address the concerns of key stakeholders, including users, designers, and developers?  
- [ ] Are the KPIs presented in a way that stakeholders can understand and trust?
