## Technical Specifications Review

### üïµÔ∏è What has been quality checked?

#### **Purpose and Alignment with Functional Specifications**

- [ ] Does the document clearly link each technical detail to the corresponding functional requirements?  
- [ ] Are all features and mechanics from the Functional Specifications fully addressed?  
- [ ] Is the technical implementation consistent with the project‚Äôs objectives?  

#### **Scope and Audience**

- [ ] Does the document focus on the technical aspects required to achieve the project‚Äôs goals?  
- [ ] Is the document accessible and understandable to both technical and non-technical stakeholders?  
- [ ] Are all technical decisions justified within the scope and constraints of the project?  

#### **Development Environment Setup**

- [ ] Are the hardware and software requirements realistic and clearly defined?  
- [ ] Are setup instructions detailed enough to allow developers to begin work without delays?  
- [ ] Are coding conventions and workflows described to ensure consistency and collaboration?  

#### **Folder Structure and File Organization**

- [ ] Is the proposed folder structure logical and easy to navigate?  
- [ ] Does it support efficient development and maintenance?  
- [ ] Is it scalable to accommodate future updates or additional features?  

#### **Data Structures and Implementation Details**

- [ ] Are the data structures and coding methodologies clearly defined and maintainable?  
- [ ] Are the provided code snippets and guidelines consistent with best practices?  
- [ ] Do the implementation details support clarity, modularity, and scalability?  

#### **App Flow and User Navigation**

- [ ] Is the app flow described clearly and intuitively?  
- [ ] Do the descriptions of key screens and their interactions align with user expectations?  
- [ ] Are transitions between screens well-defined and user-friendly?  

#### **Gameplay Features and Interactions**

- [ ] Are all key features and mechanics sufficiently detailed for accurate implementation?  
- [ ] Are the logic and dependencies for user interactions robust and well-documented?  
- [ ] Are edge cases and potential exceptions addressed within the gameplay features?  

#### **Error Handling and Feedback**

- [ ] Does the document outline how errors are handled and feedback is provided to users?  
- [ ] Are error messages and system responses designed to enhance the user experience?  
- [ ] Is the error-handling approach consistent across all app features?  

#### **Testing and QA Support**

- [ ] Does the document provide sufficient detail to support quality assurance testing?  
- [ ] Are workflows, folder structures, and coding conventions designed to facilitate debugging?  
- [ ] Is there a clear plan for validating technical implementations against the specifications?  

#### **Clarity and Accessibility**

- [ ] Is the document structured logically and easy to follow?  
- [ ] Are all technical terms and concepts explained for the intended audience?  
- [ ] Do visual aids like diagrams, tables, or mockups improve understanding?  

#### **Scalability and Future Updates**

- [ ] Does the document account for potential future expansions or modifications?  
- [ ] Are the folder structure, coding methodologies, and app flow adaptable to new features?  
- [ ] Are provisions made for iterative development or changes in requirements?  

#### **Visualization and Documentation**

- [ ] Are mockups, diagrams, and code snippets accurate and actionable?  
- [ ] Do visual representations align with the described workflows and structures?  
- [ ] Are they sufficient to guide implementation without ambiguity?  

#### **Consistency with Project Goals**

- [ ] Does the technical implementation enhance the overall user experience?  
- [ ] Is it aligned with the timeline, resources, and objectives of the project?  
- [ ] Do the technical decisions support both short-term deliverables and long-term goals?
