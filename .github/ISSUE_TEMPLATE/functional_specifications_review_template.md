## Functional Specifications Review

### üïµÔ∏è What has been quality checked?

#### **Project Vision and Objectives**

- [ ] Does the document clearly articulate the vision and objectives of the game?  
- [ ] Are the educational and entertainment aspects well-integrated?  
- [ ] Are the objectives measurable and actionable?  

#### **Scope and Out-of-Scope**

- [ ] Is the scope adequately defined, detailing what the project will and will not cover?  
- [ ] Are exclusions (e.g., camera-based enigmas, NFC technology) reasonable given the constraints?  
- [ ] Is the reasoning for exclusions clear and justified?  

#### **Target Audience and Accessibility**

- [ ] Does the document effectively identify the target audience and their needs?  
- [ ] Is the game designed with accessibility and inclusivity in mind (e.g., language support, simplified interactions)?  

#### **Functional Requirements**

- [ ] Are the functional requirements for physical and digital components detailed and feasible?  
- [ ] Are card types, app features, and integration mechanisms (e.g., code validation, hint systems) clearly described?  

#### **Game Mechanics**

- [ ] Are the game mechanics well-defined and engaging?  
- [ ] Are the rules for combining cards, solving puzzles, and progressing intuitive and balanced?  
- [ ] Do the mechanics align with the educational objectives?  

#### **Deliverables and Performance Metrics**

- [ ] Are the deliverables clearly outlined and achievable within the project‚Äôs timeline?  
- [ ] Do the performance metrics and end-game ranking systems contribute to replayability and user satisfaction?  

#### **Scenario Design and Game Progression**

- [ ] Are the scenarios and gameplay progression detailed enough to guide development?  
- [ ] Are the tutorial and levels logically connected and engaging?  
- [ ] Does the narrative tie well with the game‚Äôs educational goals?  

#### **Technical and Non-Functional Requirements**

- [ ] Are the technical requirements (e.g., app functionality, card specifications) realistic and relevant?  
- [ ] Do the non-functional requirements (e.g., performance, environmental impact) align with project goals?  

#### **Mockups and Visual Design**

- [ ] Does the document include sufficient mockups and visual references?  
- [ ] Do Figma designs and card templates provide actionable guidance for development?  
- [ ] Do visual aids enhance understanding of the gameplay flow?  

#### **Integration and Usability**

- [ ] Is the integration between the physical cards and the digital app seamless and user-friendly?  
- [ ] Is the reliance on alphanumeric codes for interactions efficient?  
- [ ] Do additional features (e.g., visual or audio feedback) enhance the user experience?  

#### **Testing and Validation**

- [ ] Does the document outline how the functional specifications will be validated through testing?  
- [ ] Is there a clear plan to test scenarios, mechanics, and interactions to identify potential issues?  

#### **Clarity and Usability of the Document**

- [ ] Is the document well-organized and easy to navigate?  
- [ ] Can stakeholders, including developers and QA testers, easily extract actionable insights?  
- [ ] Do the glossary, tables, and diagrams contribute to overall clarity?  

#### **Future Relevance and Scalability**

- [ ] Does the document consider the potential for future expansions or iterations?  
- [ ] Is the design scalable to allow for new scenarios or updated mechanics in future releases?
