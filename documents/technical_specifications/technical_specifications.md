# 1. Introduction

# Document Purpose & Definition

The goal of the Technical Specifications is to take the Functional Requirements which defines the features, scope and goals of the project, to dissect each requirement and turn it into instructions, as clear as possible, to guide the development team as well as the quality assurance team in the successful completion of their mission.

We therefore encourage thorough reading of the [Functional Specifications](https://github.com/algosup/2024-2025-project-2-serious-game-team-8/blob/main/documents/functional_specifications/functional_specifications.md) before reading further.

The goal of the Technical Requirements is to clarify as many dark areas as possible to avoid the engineers making decisions.
In a sense, while the Functional Requirements represent the "What/Why" aspect of the project, the Technical Requirements are supposed to represent the "How" of the project.

With that being said, we will try to cover as many functional and non-functional aspects of the project while making technological and architectural decisions, evaluating those decisions, measuring their associated risks and impact (providing mitigation) and compare those to other potential solutions.

The document should also benefit other stakeholders and project owners by giving insight into our methodology and may serve as a future reference for maintenance or simple documentation purposes.

## Scope

The scope of the project is to prioritize educating users on climate change through engaging, interactive elements, with the gameplay serving as a supportive framework to reinforce the educational objectives.

## Target audience 

The document is primarily intended for stakeholders, providing a clear understanding of the project's objectives and scope. Additionally, it serves as a valuable reference for developers and QA teams, offering insights into the design and implementation aspects.

# Project Overview 

## Project Brief

As stated in the functional requirements, the goal of the project is to create a serious game focused on climate change, combining a board game with cards and a mobile app, which are both required to play, creating a integrated and interactive experience. The mobile app will be designed using Godot.

We have been given 7 weeks to finish the project.
We chose to develop a board and mobile game because it allows us to concentrate on exploring and researching climate change and integrating these elements into a serious game. This approach aligns with our focus, without the added complexity of developing a PC game.

## Requirements 

While this document aims to be as clear and concise as possible to ensure a full understanding of the mobile game's implementation, some basic coding knowledge is necessary to fully grasp the code-related sections. The engine utilized will be Godot 4.0 and the code will be GDScript.

The game will be able to be run on IOS/Android and you will require the board game in order to play.

## Setting up the development environment 

The first step is to set up the development environment, which we can define as follows:

### Hardware Requirements

- A mobile phone 
- A pc 
- A physical board and cards for the game
- Additional papers which would include the tutorial/manual 

### Software Requirements

- Any OS that supports Godot
- Any text editor 
- GitHub or any other source control management, [GitHub](https://github.com/) is recommended for this task.

## User requirements

The user should expect a basic explanation of the game in the form of a tutorial 
which will be provided in a pamphlet along with the cards.


### Coding Methodology

#### <ins>Workflow</ins>

As this game combines a mobile app with a card game, the focus is split between the app’s development and the implementation of the cards. For details about the cards and their functionality, refer to the [Functional Specifications](https://github.com/algosup/2024-2025-project-2-serious-game-team-8/blob/main/documents/functional_specifications/functional_specifications.md). This section will focus primarily on the app’s implementation.

#### <ins>Coding Conventions</ins>

1. **Variables and constants**
	- Use snake_case for variables and UPPERCASE_WITH_UNDERSCORES for constants.
	- Choose descriptive names that clearly indicate their purpose.

2. **Function Names**
	- Use snake_case for function names.
	- Begin with a verb to clearly describe the function’s action or purpose.

3. **Class Names**
	- Use PascalCase for class names to distinguish them from variables and functions.
	- Class names should be nouns or noun phrases that describe the purpose of the class.

4. **Signals** 
	- Use snake_case for signals, with names that describe the event being triggered.
    - Prefix connected functions with _on_ to clarify they are signal handlers.

5. **Scene and Node Names**
	- Use lowerCamelCase for scenes and node names to distinguish them from variables and scripts.
    - Use descriptive names that indicate the role of the scene or node.

#### <ins>Commenting Conventions </ins>

Comment near 100% of the Functions in the code

#### <ins>Documenting Conventions</ins>

All project documentation will be written in **Markdown**. This includes technical documentation, code comments, and user manuals. Markdown files will be stored in the `docs/` folder in the repository.


## Setting up the game

### Hardware requirements 

- Mobile device, either Android version 5.0 and higher, or iOS version 14 and higher.
- Cards (see F.S.(TODO) For more detail)

### Software requirements 

- Godot Version 4.0
- Figma

# 2. Technical Specifications 

The technical Specifications will attempt to go through the development process of the game.

## Folder Structure 

The folder structure of the serious game project will be defined as follows, according to the requirements of GDScript and the multiple facets of game development.

- The resources folder will be used to store different types of material such as sprites, 
images, music files and so on.

- The script folder will be used to store the code of each scene.

- The scene folder will be used to store each scene of the game.

## Data structures

### GDScript Overview

GDScript is a high-level, dynamically-typed scripting language used in Godot for game logic. Its syntax is simple and Python-like, making it accessible yet powerful for game development.

### Flowchart 

In this flowchart, you can see how the user will be able to navigate through the app.

### Splash Screen

Displays the game's logo and transitions to the main menu after a brief delay.

- Code implementation

```markdown

1. Initialize Splash Screen
   └── Load background
   └── Load logo
   └── Set up loading text (e.g., "Loading...")

2. Set Up UI
   └── Create a fixed UI layer
       └── Add background
       └── Add logo
       └── Add loading text

3. Display Splash Screen
   └── Render all elements:
       └── Show background color or image

       └── **Decrement**: Decrease the number or reset to 9 if it reaches 0.

4. Validate Code
   └── On enter button press:
       └── Check if the input matches the correct code ("4732").
       └── If correct:
           └── Display the win page.
           └── Mark Chapter 1 as complete.
       └── If incorrect:
           └── Display the error page.
```

### Code win page

Displays a congratulatory message to the player for successfully solving the puzzle by entering the correct combination.

- Code Implementation
```markdown
1. Initialize Code Win Page
   └── Display the win page content.

2. Handle Close Button
   └── On close button press:
       └── Change the scene to the chapter selection page.

```
### Code error page

Alerts the player when an incorrect code is entered and penalizes them by deducting time from the countdown timer (feature pending implementation).

- Code implementation
```markdown
1. Initialize Code Error page
   └── Display the error page content.

2. Handle Close Button
   └── On close button press:
       └── Remove the error page from the scene.
```
