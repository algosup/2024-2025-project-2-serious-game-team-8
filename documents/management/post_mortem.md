## Key Achievements

- 
<!-- - The working prototype has a great design, and the developed pages are polished and refined.
- The final presentation conveyed all key information clearly to the client and was better than previous presentations.
- Git & GitHub organization was overall clear and efficient.
- Our motivation benefited from team cohesion and management that allowed members to work independently.
- Pavlo, our new member, learned to work as a team on a software project. -->

## Challenges

- 
<!-- - Our project tended to expand into side features that, while relevant, were not critical.
- Some team members were not as involved in the project as others.
- We faced numerous dead ends, and our development pace was hindered by technical issues.
- Respecting deadlines and managing time effectively were consistent challenges throughout the project. -->

## Root Causes

- 
<!-- - The definition of critical features should have been approached with more critical thinking and review.
- A lack of strict management and oversight led to some team members being less involved.
- We began developing the application without mastering the language, leading to functionality issues.
- The project duration was short, with only five weeks for the development phase, making it difficult to meet deadlines while aiming for a refined application. -->

## Lessons Learnt

- 
<!-- - Better management with improved risk anticipation and efforts to involve all team members should lead to a better product and less stress towards deadlines.
- Mastering the programming language before starting the development phase will help avoid future problems. -->

## Conclusion

<!-- Overall, this project was a valuable learning experience for everyone, despite technical and management challenges. The insights gained will be beneficial for delivering higher quality work in future projects, and the team will work to avoid repeating the same mistakes. -->
