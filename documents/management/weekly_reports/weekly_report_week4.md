# Weekly Report - Week 4

## Overview

This week had limited project time but was highly productive nonetheless. Deliverables were completed, and an MVP was coded.

## Accomplishments

1. **MVP**
    - Significant progress was made on the MVP this week. We developed:
        - Loading Screen;
        - Chapter Selection;
        - Parameters Page;
        - Main Page;
        - Machine Page;
        - Hint Page.
2. **Documents**
    - The main document advancements this week were:
        - The **Functional Specifications** were improved, particularly in the design section.
        - The **Technical Specifications** were fully written, approved, and delivered.
3. **Beta Testing**
    - We conducted our first tests on the MVP. Testers primarily included ALGOSUP students and B3 residents.

## Challenges

1. **Time Allocation**
    - We had very limited project time this week (only 1 hour).
2. **Team Management**
    - Managing the team without dedicated project time was challenging and primarily conducted remotely via Slack.
3. **Finding Beta Testers**
    - Although we planned to conduct more tests (5 additional sessions), time constraints limited us to only 3.

## Plan for Next Week

1. **New Test Sessions**
    - To build a substantial database, we need to conduct additional tests with:
        - ALGOSUP students;
        - Foreign teachers;
        - B3 residents.
2. **Documents**
    - Deliver the following documents:
        - Test Plan;
        - Test Cases;
        - Weekly Reports.
3. **Second Prototype**
    - The development team will iterate based on feedback gathered from the test sessions conducted this week.

## Conclusion

This week was highly productive, and we overcame several challenges. The first phase of this project is now complete, and we are committed to maintaining this momentum moving forward.
