# Weekly Report - Week 4

## Overview

This week was the last one before our product deliverable. Consequently, we worked extensively to provide a complete and polished outcome, aiming to take pride in this 6-week-long project.

## Accomplishments

1. **Documents**
    - Essential documents were created to meet the deadlines:
        - The **User Manual** was fully designed and written during this week.
        - Management artifacts were completed.
        - The **Test Cases** were written and applied to the product.
2. **Application**
    - The development team completed the application tasks as planned:
        - Chapter 1 was fully developed:
            - Mixer enigma created and refined.
            - Door enigma designed and implemented to provide a proper chapter conclusion.
            - Hint system implemented.
        - Settings refinement with the addition of SFX control.
        - Sound effects implementation.
        - Releases published on the GitHub repository.
3. **Designing**
    - Chapter 1 was fully designed and underwent several iterations before release:
        - Cards' designs were created.
        - Enigmas' designs were finalized.
        - Cards were printed.
4. **Testing**
    - Feedback was gathered through testing, especially on Chapter 1:
        - Tested with ALGOSUP students.
        - Tested with B3 residents.

## Challenges

1. **Team Communication**
    - Managing and assigning tasks effectively between the design and development teams proved challenging due to the high workload.
2. **Perfectionism**
    - Excessive time was spent striving for perfection, which reduced time available for iterations.
3. **Time Management**
    - Balancing the significant number of tasks with limited time and delegating appropriately was difficult.

## Plan for Next Week

1. **Oral Preparation**
    - Create a pitch deck.
    - Write the presentation text.
    - Rehearse thoroughly.
2. **Game Fixing**
    - Correct card design misconceptions.
    - Address application issues based on designer feedback.

## Conclusion

This week was highly productive, but the final test session negatively impacted team morale just before the deliverable. Despite this, we are determined to finalize the project successfully.
