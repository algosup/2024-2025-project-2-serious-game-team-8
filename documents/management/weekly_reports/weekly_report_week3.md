# Weekly Report - Week 3

## Overview

This week was mainly focused on the functional specifications and game designs. We made significant progress thanks to dedicated project time and some overtime.

## Accomplishments

1. **Documents**
    - The Functional Specifications were completed and released on the main branch before the deadline.
    - Work on the Technical Specifications has started, building on the Functional Specifications.
2. **Game Design**
    - Significant progress was made in game design this week:
        - We have designed the entire narrative part of the game and now have a script to follow and build around.
        - The first prototype, which will serve as the tutorial, has been designed.
            - A flowchart has been created to help map out the different cards.
            - All the cards for the tutorial have been designed.
        - An application has been designed to play the prototype.
        - We also developed one enigma for each level, including the tutorial.
3. **Reviews**
    - Reviews were conducted during the week. The documents reviewed include:
        - Project Charter
        - Weekly Reports
        - Risk Management

## Challenges

1. **Appealing Design**
    - Creating an appealing design was a challenge. None of our team members have strong design skills, making it difficult to create visually engaging designs.
2. **Time Management**
    - Managing time was challenging due to the heavy workload and tight deadlines. As a result, some overtime was necessary to deliver our documents on time.

## Plan for Next Week

1. **Documents**
    - Complete the Technical Specifications by Friday evening.
2. **Application Development**
    - Fully design and implement the application using GODOT to enable game testing.
3. **First Tests**
    - Once the application is ready, conduct initial tests. Cards will be printed and tested by other students and Konstantinos.

## Conclusion

Our team worked collaboratively on the design aspects to progress quickly and efficiently. Communication within the team was effective, and the project is now taking off, boosting the overall morale of the group.
