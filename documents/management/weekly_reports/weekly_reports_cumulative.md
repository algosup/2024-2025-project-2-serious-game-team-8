# Weekly Report - Week 1

## Overview

This week marked the launch of the project. Consequently, most advancements were document-based, even though no official project time was allocated for this work.

## Accomplishments

1. **Project Analysis**
    - We defined our game concept along with some basic rules and mechanics.
2. **One-Sheet Design Document**
    - It has been written and sent to the client for approval.
3. **Management Documents**
    - The essential documents for effective project management have been created:
        - Work breakdown structure;
        - Gantt Chart;
        - KPIs.
4. **GitHub Initialization**
    - We initialized the repository and established conventions for its use.

## Challenges

1. **New Team**
    - The main challenge was ensuring effective communication among team members who had never worked together before.
2. **Missing Team Member**
    - One team member was absent for the first four days.
3. **Time Allocation**
    - The team had to work on the project outside of dedicated project hours, complicating task management.
4. **Game Design**
    - None of us had prior experience designing a serious game. We need to learn quickly and efficiently.
5. **GODOT Learning**
    - The software engineers need to familiarize themselves with GODOT and GDScript, a new programming language.

## Plan for Next Week

1. **Documents**
    - Several documents should be written or at least started:
        - Project Charter;
        - Management Artifacts;
        - README;
        - Functional Specifications.
2. **Design**
    - With the core concept defined, game designs should be created to provide an appealing initial visual.

## Conclusion

Our team encountered several challenges during this first project week (time constraints, communication, etc.). However, the project has progressed well and appears to be on track to becoming an engaging and effective serious game.

        - Skeleton created.
    - The Technical Specifications document was also initiated:
        - GitHub Set-Up;
        - Conventions outlined.
5. **Research**
    - Conducted research on climate change to support the project.

## Challenges

1. **Pivoting**

2. **Communication**
    - Maintaining effective communication within the team remained a challenge.
3. **Time Allocation**
    - Working on the project without dedicated project time continued to complicate task management.
4. **Hybrid Game Development**
    - The team needed to learn how to create a hybrid game effectively.

## Plan for Next Week

1. **Documents**
    - Finalize the Functional Specifications.
    - Complete the Technical Specifications.
2. **Design**
    - Create all, or at least the main, game assets.
3. **Game**
