# Weekly Report - Week 7

## Overview

This week marked the final stretch leading up to the oral presentation. The main focus was on preparing the pitch.

## Accomplishments

1. **Pitch**
    - During this week, every team member wrote their individual texts for the oral presentation, scheduled for Friday morning.
2. **Pitch Deck**
    - To complement and illustrate our speeches, the pitch deck was fully completed:
        - Theme selection;
        - Task distribution;
        - Slide creation.
3. **Documents**
    - Finalization of the management artifacts.
    - Revision of the README file.

## Challenges

1. **Team Management**
    - Managing the team and ensuring that each individual text flowed seamlessly into a cohesive presentation was challenging.
2. **Pitch Deck**
    - Finding an appropriate theme and designing slides that effectively conveyed the topic of climate change was more difficult than anticipated.
3. **Missing Member**
    - One team member was unavailable, so we had to redistribute their part of the oral presentation among the remaining members.

## Plan for Next Week

There is no plan for the next week since the project concludes on Friday, December 20.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, this week was highly productive, and we successfully maintained team cohesion. We are prepared for the oral presentation and proud of the work we accomplished during this project.
