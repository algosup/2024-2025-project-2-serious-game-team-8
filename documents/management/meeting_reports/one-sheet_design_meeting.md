## Message Track

Here is the message sent to the client.

```
Good evening, Mr JEANNIN,

You can find our One-Sheet Design for the serious game you provided us as a linked document.
The document's content is accurate. However, the visuals should be considered a prototype. In the end, it wouldn't be these assets; only their positions are accurate.

Yours sincerely,

THIZEAU Maxime,  Team 8's Project Manager.
