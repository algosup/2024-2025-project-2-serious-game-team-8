## Message Track

Here is the message sent to the client.

```
Good evening, Mr JEANNIN,

You can find our One-Sheet Design for the serious game you provided us as a linked document.
The document's content is accurate. However, the visuals should be considered a prototype. In the end, it wouldn't be these assets; only their positions are accurate.

Yours sincerely,

THIZEAU Maxime,  Team 8's Project Manager.

And here is the client response.

```
Sounds interesting. The serious part is a bit thin but I suspect it's due to the young age of your target audience. Kids already spend too much time watching screens, try to think of ways to make them interact more with the physical world. State clearly what you want them to learn (the serious part) and then try to make it as fun as possible (the game part). Maybe if you were to pick an older audience you could teach more sophisticated concepts.
