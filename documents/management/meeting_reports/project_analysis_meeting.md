## Ideas

### Idea n°1

The first idea proposed was a Tera Nil-like game. It would have been a city builder where we let the player build is own city. 
However, therre would be two possible endings at this game:
- The first one would be reached when the planet is destroyed.
- The other would be reached by following an eco-friendly path to preserve the planet.

The game was thought for letting the player build his own city at the planet's health cost.
When this last couldn't support it anymore the game will end. It would then show the user a score and a you destroy your planet, making him chocked.
The second party he would start would contain hints to help him decrease the climate change and then save the planet.

Some buildings could be really expensive with hidden benefits to prompt the user to save money by choosing cheaper buildings.

#### ✅ Accepted

### Idea n°2

The game would be a platform game were you play a polar bear.\
The User should jump from piece of ice to piece of ice.

The game would have 10 checpoints, and at every of these a question would be asked to the user. \
Those questions would be climate-changed oriented and multiple-choiced (ex: Would you rather go to the bakery at foot (5 mins) or by car (1 min)?). \
Each choice has an impact on the game. The "good answer" will not increase the difficulty much while it would rocket rise with the bad one. \
The difficulty would be shown at the melting of ice floe (less platforms than previously).

If you fall in the ocean, you lose.

#### ✅ Accepted

### Idea n°3

The game would be a tool maker. 

The user could chose which every day object he would like to build. He could also chose the Era he want to be. \
The user would be helped across the various step to build the choosen object (pen -> creating plastic, finding inc, etc).

You win by finalizing the object and lose if you don't.

#### ❌ Refused

### Idea n°4

The game would be a succession of minigames (Inspiration: dumb way to dies, Wario ware, Mario Party)

This game would contain a bunch of minigames such as:

| Name/Reference | Description                                                                                                                                | Win Condition                 | Lose Condition           | Difficulty Increase                             |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------- | ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Fruit Picker   | Trashs are throw out vehicles at the top of the screen and you should catch them with a trashbag at the bottom of the game.                | Catch all the trashs.         | Miss one or more trashs. | More trashs/Fall faster.                        |
| Temple Run     | You incarnate a pinguin and should avoid obstacles before the melting ice catch up with you.                                               | Reach the Finish line.        | Fall into Ocean.         | Ice melts faster/More obstacles.                |
| Switch Light   | The user enters a sequel of rooms with three lights. They could be on or off. He should switch them all off before going to the next room. | Turn off every lights.        | Miss three lights.       | Decrease lives/Reduce Game Timer.               |
| Recycling      | The user should put all the different trashs in their according ben (carton box -> carton ben, glass botel -> glass ben, etc.).            | Every trash sorted correctly. | Misssort some trashs.    | Faster treadmill/Decrease mistakes possibility. |

This game would have no ends. You can compete with other players by obtaining the best score possible (Each mini-game gives points).

#### ✅ Accepted

### Idea n°5

The game would be a 2D puzzle game.

This idea hasn't been explain more.

#### ❌ Refused

### Idea n°6

This game would be an escape game.

The user incarnates a fish and should avoid the different obstacles represented by pollution (bags, plastic, bottles, etc.) and fuel leaks. \
The game would become harder each passing level by increasing obstacles and/or reducing the time to finish the level.

#### ❌ Refused || ➥ Idea n°4 mini game +

### Idea n°7

The game would be a merge game. 

The user could merge everything from elements to existing objects.
The speciality here would be that every merge have an impact on a global variable. Also, the screen would be flowded accordingly to your variable, the higher it is, the less you see.

Therefore, the user loses the game when the screen is entirely flowded and win by discovering all the good merges.

#### ❌ Refused

### Idea n°8 

This game would be a strategy game and a company owner simulator.

The user incarnates a CTO and should manage his ressources such as money, natural ressources, human, etc. to make his company grows.
The hard part here is to do the right choices to stay eco-responsble and don't increase the climate changes.
There are also other companies that you should deal with not to lose the game.

#### ❌ Refused

### Idea n°9

This game would be a fishing game with two modes:
- The first mode is a normal fishing game. The user should fish fishes and avoid trashes on the path to them. The lower you get the higher the score is.
- The second mode is a cleaning version of the first one. In this mode, you are not aiming to fish but to clean the ocean by avoiding fishes.

There would not be any wining conditions, more a high score to beat. However, you can lose by fishing a trash (first mode) or catching a fish (second mode).
