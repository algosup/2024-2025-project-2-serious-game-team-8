# One-Sheet Design Meeting

## Information
**Duration**: 2-2.5 hour(s) \
**Physical Attendants**: Maxime, Benoit, Aurélien \
**Remote Attendant**: Mathis, Thibaud, Antoine \
**Absent**: Pavlo \
**Topic**: Pivoting game idea to one more suitable for the project

## Procedure
1. Brainstorming
    - New ideas have been expressed.
2. Choosing
    - We choosed one of the ideas.
3. Description
    - Once the choice was made, we started defining it in depth.

## Ideas

### Idea n°1

The first idea was to keep the mini-game compilation idea but to improve it to fit the client expectation. \
To do so, we should learn information about climate change to create adequate mini-games.

#### ❌ Refused

### Idea n°2

The second ideas was a hybrid card-screen escape game:
On one hand, the enigmas and puzzles would be designed on physical cards that the player would have to manipulate. On the other hand, a mobile app would serve as a guide, telling the story, checking answers, providing clues, and directing the player to reveal specific cards (which are numbered).

#### ✅ Accepted

### Idea n°3

The third idea was a full digital escape game:
This would make the game less convenient and prevent physical manipulation. Additionally, it would require two screens: one for the cards and one for the guide.

#### ❌ Refused

### Idea n°4

The last idea was a 3D game where the player could move around in the room(s) to escape:
This would be on PC. An escape game using this solution would offer two benefits:
First, it would introduce an important aspect—exploration—giving the player the role of a detective who must observe and capture details.
Second, it would be more immersive, providing greater freedom for exploration and puzzle-switching. Additionally, this approach would allow for more complex designs, music, and animations, and could be developed iteratively from a simple game to something more advanced. However, it would add significantly more work for the developers, particularly due to programming the interactions between the objects and the puzzle logic behind them.

#### ❌ Refused

## Chosen Idea

In the end, the game selected was the idea number 2, the hybrid escape game.
This would allow an easier manipulation of the game and to have a wider targeted audience. \
Moreover, multi players could play at the same time with this option.

## Description

### Game Design Structure & Enigmas

- **Core Concept:**
  - Players face counter-intuitive information, creating a challenging experience.
  - They must either understand the problem or experiment with answers to discover the solution, learning ecological truths throughout the game.

- **Sensory Dimension:**
  - The game avoids being a simple multiple-choice quiz on ecology.
  - Each enigma has a sensory component, engaging players through interactive, physical elements.
  - Solving an enigma unlocks a corresponding physical puzzle, progressing the game.

- **Interaction Between Puzzles:**
  - Each puzzle combines sensory and logical elements for a deeper player experience.
  - Solving puzzles requires analysis and critical thinking, enhancing player engagement and understanding of climate-related information.
  - This structure makes the game more fun and dynamic as players piece together a larger puzzle to advance.

### Enigma Structure & Progression

- **Consistent Theme:**
  - Puzzles follow a coherent theme, starting with basic ecological concepts.
  - Later enigmas build on previous answers, exploring more complex environmental issues.

- **Bottom-Up Resolution Path:**
  - The game is structured in layers:
    - **Primary Puzzles:** Initial set of puzzles that players can solve in parallel.
    - **Intermediate Puzzles:** Unlocked by solving primary puzzles; each provides a key or clue.
    - **Final Puzzle:** All keys/clues from intermediate puzzles are needed to solve the final enigma and escape the room.

- **Flexible Progression:**
  - Players have the freedom to work on multiple puzzles simultaneously, reducing the risk of getting stuck in a linear sequence.
  - The number of layers and puzzle paths can be adjusted for balance and difficulty.
