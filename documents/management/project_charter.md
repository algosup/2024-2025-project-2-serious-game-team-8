# 2024 - 2025 Project-2 Serious Game Team-8 - Project Charter

## Project definition

This project aims to teach and educate our users about the dangers of climate changes and how to avoid them at maximum.
Therefore, a serious game will be created to make the learning more entertaining.

This project has not been asked by a company. Therefore, the client would be our school director, the communication would be done between him and our program manager, Benoit DE KEYN.

## Scope

This project should be done in GODOT 4. This one allow the creation of games in various platforms (Web browsers, Windows, MacOS, Consoles, and Mobile). 

The serious game should be edutermaint but can take every form. It could also be in 2D or in 3D.

## Project Plan

On November 6th 2024, we had a meeting to brainstorm possible game ideas and to sort them or modified them to a more feasible point of view. At the end of it, three main ideas have been sorted.

To communicate with the client, it would mainly be done by e-mails exchanges. However, in son=me specific occasion some meeting with the client could be organized for a better clarity.

This project will be using the Waterfall project method du to the lack of working hours for the project. However, we plan to use some aspects of SCRUM management and Agile testing to create a bug-free game.

The planning will be made by defining the tasks and objectives a serious game can involved. Thos tasks would be hierarchied according to their importance in the project. They would also be assigned to one or many team members to complete them in the most efficate way possible. \
Finally, these tasks and objectives would be gathered on an external Spreadsheet you can find [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YawyIgXylS97_ymcw2Y4kwv85DKmZqUtg69qEnfmWP8/edit?usp=sharing).

After the final presentation which will take place on December, 20th 2024, we will do a post-mortem analysis to summarize what happened and make a report to the client.
