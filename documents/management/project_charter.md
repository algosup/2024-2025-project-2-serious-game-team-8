# 2024 - 2025 Project-2 Serious Game Team-8 - Project Charter

## Project Definition

The objective of this project is to educate users on the dangers of climate change and offer actionable steps to mitigate its effects. To achieve this, we will develop an engaging and educational serious game.

This project is not initiated by an external company; therefore, the client is the school director. Communication with the client will be managed by our Program Manager, Benoit DE KEYN.

## Scope

This project will be developed using the Godot 4 game engine, chosen for its versatility and capability to deploy on various platforms, including web browsers, Windows, macOS, consoles, and mobile devices.

The serious game will combine educational content with entertainment, allowing for flexibility in its design. The game may be in either 2D or 3D format, depending on the direction taken during development.

## Out of Scope

The following elements are outside the scope of this project:

- Inclusion of complex multiplayer or online gameplay.
- Expansive cross-platform testing (beyond the major target platforms: web browsers, Windows, and mobile devices).
- Development of additional features or game expansions post-delivery unless explicitly requested and approved by the client.

## Project Plan

On November 6th, 2024, we conducted a brainstorming session to generate and refine game ideas. We shortlisted three feasible concepts to proceed with.

Communication with the client will primarily be through email. However, meetings may be scheduled as needed for clarity on specific issues.

We have chosen a Waterfall project management approach, supplemented by elements of Scrum and Agile testing. This hybrid approach is due to limited available working hours, yet it allows for flexibility in testing and iterative improvements.

Tasks and objectives will be outlined based on the components required for a serious game. These tasks will be prioritized according to their significance and assigned to team members to ensure efficient completion. A detailed project schedule and task assignment can be found in the external spreadsheet [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YawyIgXylS97_ymcw2Y4kwv85DKmZqUtg69qEnfmWP8/edit?usp=sharing).

Upon project completion, a post-mortem analysis will be conducted after the final presentation on December 20th, 2024, to evaluate performance and document lessons learned for the client.

## Risks

| Risk Type                                 | Description                                                                                                           | Likelihood | Impact     | Mitigation Strategy                                      |
| ----------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- | ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Misinterpretation of Requirements         | Key requirements may be misunderstood or omitted.                                                                    | Medium     | High       | Regular client communication and clarification meetings.  |
| Unengaging Game Design                    | The game might be educational but fail to be engaging for players.                                                    | Low        | High       | Frequent testing with non-team members to gather feedback. |
| Overconfidence in Scope                   | The project scope may exceed the available time and resources.                                                        | Medium     | High       | Start small and expand iteratively based on progress.     |
| Attachment to the Product                 | Team members may become too attached to features that do not align with client requirements.                          | Low        | High       | Be open to pivoting and adapting to client feedback.      |
