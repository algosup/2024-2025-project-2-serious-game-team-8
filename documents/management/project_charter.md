# 2024 - 2025 Project-2 Serious Game Team-8 - Project Charter

## Project definition

This project aims to teach and educate our users about the dangers of climate changes and how to avoid them at maximum.
Therefore, a serious game will be created to make the learning more entertaining.

Since no specific company has been organizing <!-- find a better way to tell it --> this project. The client would be our school director, the communication would be done between him and our program manager, Benoit DE KEYN. 

## Scope

This project should be done in GODOT 4 and the serious game should be run on a web browser application. <!-- to check -->

The serious game should be edutermaint but can take every form. It could also be in 2D or in 3D.

## Stakeholders
<!-- add expectation such as game -->

## Project Plan

<!-- On May 13th 2024, we had a meeting with the client to explain some blurry points written in the brief that had been transmitted to us during the holidays. It was decided that additional questions would be made via e-mail and that those communication documents could be uploaded to Github if needed.

This project will be using the waterfall project method due to the limited timeframe. However, we plan to use some aspects of SCRUM management with iterations over an MVP. This incrementation will limit the number of bugs by allowing regression testing.

The planning will be made by defining the tasks and objectives pointed out in the brief and during the meeting. Each of these will be sorted by importance and distributed accordingly. To manage them, we will use a GitHub project in our repository to centralize all the resources. Additional management tools will be used to track the achievements and bottlenecks during the project and keep the client informed during the whole duration of the project.

After the final presentation which will take place on June, 21st 2024, we will do a post-mortem analysis to summarize what happened and make a report to the client. -->
